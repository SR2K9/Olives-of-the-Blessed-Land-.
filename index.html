      <h2 class="card-title">Legendary Trees</h2>
      <p class="card-text">These trees hold legends. Unheard stories, they pass on these stories through their produce.
        Famous around the world, their olives speak. Palestinian olives—especially the Nabali and Baladi varieties—are known for their distinctive, rich, and earthy flavor. The olive oil produced from them is often cold-pressed and extra virgin, highly sought after for its purity and low acidity.

      <h2 class="card-title">Olive Harvest</h2>
      <p>After months of waiting, the time comes when the greenish sheet of olives is removed. One by one they fall in the baskets in a pile.
        They travel around the world, going from home to home sharing the love they were cared with. The olive harvest is also a powerful act of resilience. Farmers often face challenges such as restricted access to their land or damage to their trees due to the political situation. Yet, every year, they return—determined to care for their groves and protect their cultural and economic lifeline. For many, harvesting olives is not only about livelihood—it's a form of peaceful resistance and connection to their land.

  <h2 class="card title">The Pride of Al-Aqsa</h2>
  <p>Olive trees have existed in the lands of Palestine for thousands of years. Researches suggest that they have existed for more than 6,000 years! Al-Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site in Islam, holds profound spiritual, historical, and cultural significance—and within its blessed courtyards and surroundings, the olive tree stands as a powerful symbol of that sacred connection.
    These trees have always been a pride for not only the Palestinians but also for Al-Aqsa and it will always remain their pride because 'Land recongnizes it's People'.
